Red-yellow flowers appear at the end of winter, and also at the beginning of spring. Both male and female flowers are borne on same tree.[3] Climatic conditions have a significant influence on the time of flowering.[3] In South Asia, flowering starts in December in the south, in January in Bihar and Bengal, in February in eastern Uttar Pradesh, and in February–March in northern India. The duration of flowering is 20–25 days for the Dasheri variety, while panicle emergence occurs in early December and flower opening is completed by February. The Neelum variety produces two crops a year in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, but it flowers only once in North Indian conditions.[7]

The mango is an irregular, egg-shaped fruit which is a fleshy drupe.[3] Mangos are typically 8–12 centimetres (3–5 inches) long and greenish yellow in color. The fruits can be round, oval, heart, or kidney shaped.[3] Mango fruits are green when they are unripe.[3] The interior flesh is bright orange and soft with a large, flat pit in the middle.[3] Mangos are mature in April and May. Raw mangos can be used in the making of pickles and chutneys.[8] Ripe mangos are a popular fruit throughout the world. The skin and pulp account for 85% of the mango's weight, and the remaining 15% comes from the stone (seed).[9]

Chemistry
Mangiferin (a pharmacologically active hydroxylated xanthone C-glycoside) is extracted from mango at high concentrations from the young leaves (172 g/kg), bark (107 g/kg), and from old leaves (94 g/kg).[10] Allergenic urushiols are present in the fruit peel.[11]

Taxonomy
Mangoes are believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica were domesticated separately in South Asia and Southeast Asia over centuries, resulting in two distinct genetic populations in modern mangoes – the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian
